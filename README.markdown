NativeFSEvents
--------------

NativeFSEvents is a Java library for monitoring files and folders using native hooks on 64 bit Mac OS X. It is used by [AutoRefresher](https://github.com/zch/AutoRefresher), an eclipse plug-in for refreshing files automatically as they change, and has only been tested as part of that project.
